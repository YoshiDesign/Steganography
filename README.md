# Steganography Flask web/app and CLI tool

Conceal messages in plain (digitally temporal) sight and decode them.
The web interface only supports png
The CLI interface supports png & jpg / jpeg

## Python3.6

Images are stored on the FS when using the web interface.
The CLI tool applies encoding without creating a backup or duplicate image. Don't use -I and say I didn't warn you!
